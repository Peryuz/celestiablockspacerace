- For Celestia Blockspace ITN, you will be able to handle your transactions in a very short time with the Script that allows you to learn node institutions (Validator, Light, Bridge & Full Storage), data resets and node ids. 

- When you start the process with a single line of code below, it asks you what you want to do at the very beginning. Whichever operation you are going to do, you should enter its number and wait for the uploads to finish. During some uploads, it asks you to press the "Enter" key or enter some values. These are important and their explanations appear on the screen at that moment. Please do your operations by taking these explanations into consideration.

```
curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/okannako/celestiablockspacerace/main/nodescript.sh > nodescript.sh && chmod +x nodescript.sh && ./nodescript.sh
```

- After the installations are finished, please make additional checks according to yourself and make sure that the result is as it should be. If you have any questions or would like to contribute, you can interact via Github. I hope it's a smooth test for everyone.
